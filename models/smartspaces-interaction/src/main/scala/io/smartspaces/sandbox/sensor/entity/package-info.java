/**
 * An API for talking about entities, such as sensors, physical locations, etc.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A sensor is a small hardware or platform that can contain multiple subsensor
 * values. An example may be a small board with a WIFI chip and multiple
 * invidual sensors, such as temperature and humidity.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A sensor channel gives the value that a particular subsensor is reading from
 * a sensor platform. For example, one channel may give the temperature of the
 * room while another gives the humidity of the room. Multiple channels could
 * give the same sort of measurement, though for something else, for example the
 * sensor platform could have two temperature sensors, one to read room
 * temperature and another to read the fish tank temperature.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Markers are things that allow something to be identified.
